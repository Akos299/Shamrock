- [ ] Change sycl handler to namespace ? (aka )
- [ ] Builder for SchedulerMPI since it won't work with no patches
- [ ] move init/free required type in SchedulerMPI to patch & sycl interop class 
- [ ] move sycl interop init in mpi_handler
- [ ] runtime error in SchedulerMPI construction if patch type inactive
- [ ] find a better solution for sim_box (probably separate class since it allows to store translate/scalling factors)
- [ ] track uses of max_box_sz in the code (should find a way to abstract it)
- [ ] namedtimer destructor = end if not already stopped
- [ ] instance __compute_object_patch_owner with f32/f64 modes (compile time reduction)
- [ ] put instance of simbox in the SchedulerMPI
- [ ] rename SchedulerMPI to PatchScheduler ?
- [ ] add interger fields to patchdata
- [ ] patchdata nvars to templates (perf gain ???)
- [ ] patchdata_isend -> patchdata::pisend 
- [ ] patchdata_irecv -> patchdata::pirecv
- [ ] implement PatchDataBuffer with unique ptrs 
- [ ] PatchDataBufferCache ?
- [ ] SerialPatchTree attach buf by default and use accesors
- [ ] replace pos_s & pos_d by a templated postype
- [ ] move sycl kernels to namespaces instead of ::
- [ ] bind patch to specific GPU for the gpu cache
