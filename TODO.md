- [ ] Change sycl handler to namespace ? (aka SyCLHandler -> sycl_handler::)
- [ ] Builder for SchedulerMPI since it won't work with no patches
- [ ] move init/free required type in SchedulerMPI to patch & sycl interop class 
- [ ] move sycl interop init in mpi_handler
- [ ] runtime error in SchedulerMPI construction if patch type inactive
- [ ] make SimulationBox templated and sotre tranlate & scale factor
- [ ] track uses of max_box_sz in the code (should find a way to abstract it)
- [ ] namedtimer destructor = end if not already stopped
- [ ] instance __compute_object_patch_owner with f32/f64 modes (compile time reduction)
- [ ] put instance of simbox in the SchedulerMPI
- [ ] rename SchedulerMPI to PatchScheduler to handle the gpu scheduling from the same?
- [ ] add interger fields to patchdata
- [ ] patchdata nvars to templates (perf gain ???)
- [ ] patchdata_isend -> patchdata::pisend 
- [ ] patchdata_irecv -> patchdata::pirecv
- [ ] implement PatchDataBuffer with unique ptrs 
- [ ] PatchDataBufferCache ?
- [ ] SerialPatchTree attach buf by default and use accesors
- [ ] replace pos_s & pos_d by a templated postype
- [ ] move sycl kernels to namespaces instead of ::
- [ ] bind patch to specific GPU for the gpu cache ?
- [ ] to implement the variable h with cache we can create a fix array and keep neighbourgh in the walk stack, after we can iterate on all cells in the walk stack even if they are not leaf using the endrange (ineficient for big cells)
- [ ] implement the interaction box computation of the radix tree using U1 buf instead of a separate buf
- [ ] modify interface handler to exchange only some fields (exemple: exchange only omega ad later position and else)
- [ ] create a Shamrock loop handler to handle interface compute field patch field & ect
- [ ] use only patch_id or id_patch not both
- [ ] in interface split the get_flag_id part and cache it to avoid recomputing it
