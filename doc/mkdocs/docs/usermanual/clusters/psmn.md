Sorry if this is complicated but the PSMN does not really help the process, sadly ... 
It is definitely harder than on most clusters out there

##Â Getting a copy of shamrock on the PSMN

First clone the Shamrock repository :
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:tdavidcl/Shamrock.git
```

then you need to upload it to the PSMN, to do so first tar it, copy it to the PSMN, and then untar.
```bash

```
